# 499 Individual Assignment 
The individual Git Assignment

This assignment was done to get familiar with Git version control and learn how to:
* Create repositories
* Merge, Pull, Push requests
* Committing code and creating a readme, etc.

THE CODE:
The code basically deals with sorting of arrays, an array is taken and sorted via default means.

Feature 1:
Using Insertion sort to sort the array. Insertion sort is used to sort the same unsorted array and the result is then printed to see if the method successfully sorts the array or not.

Feature 2:
To get the array sorted in a descending order. For this to take place, a reverse method is made and used to take the sorted array and then reverse it.Thus, giving us the descending order. This result is also printed to check if it works correctly.

Testing:
Unit tests are implemented to check if the sorting mechanism works and if the arrays can be sorted in ascending and descending order.
